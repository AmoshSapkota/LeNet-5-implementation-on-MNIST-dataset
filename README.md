This is the PyTorch implementation of LeNet-5 provided in the code snippet is a straightforward and concise implementation of the original architecture. The model consists of a convolutional feature extractor and a fully connected classifier.
The convolutional feature extractor extracts features from the input image using a series of convolutional layers and pooling layers. The fully connected classifier then takes the extracted features and uses them to predict the output class.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function. The training loop is implemented in the training_loop() function.
